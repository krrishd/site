# Forward Philly (2015)

## Tools

We used React, Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB, vanilla JavaScript for a lot of internal/database scripting, and Heroku for infrastructure.

## My Involvement

I was recruited by Forward Philly as a part of the [PennApps Fellowship.](https://medium.com/pennapps-fellows/meet-the-pennapps-fellows-2015-2bc7e46cd256)

Forward Philly is a comprehensive real-estate product aimed at improving the quality of living in Philadelphia.

I'm under an NDA for the specifics, but my work in particular involved the creation of software within a **React-based dashboard** that involved maximizing real-estate deal flow and property valuation using **1mm+ Philly property records** sourced from various open data resources. I also worked on scripts related to maintenance of the platform and database.
