# Forward Philly

## Tools

We used React, Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB, vanilla JavaScript for a lot of internal/database scripting, and Heroku for infrastructure.

## My Involvement

I was recruited by Forward Philly as a part of the [PennApps Fellowship.](http://pennappsfellows.com)

Forward Philly is a comprehensive real-estate product aimed at improving the quality of living in Philadelphia.

I'm currently not permitted to give many specific details, but my work in particular involved the creation of software within a **React-based dashboard** that involved real-estate deal flow and property valuation using **1mm+ Philly property records** sourced from various open data resources. I also worked on scripts related to maintenance of the platform and database.
