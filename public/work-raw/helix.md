## Concept

I built Helix with three other people at [PennApps](//pennapps.com), the University of Pennsylvania's hackathon in partnership with [Major League Hacking](//mlh.io). We won two prizes: **Best Health Hack, and Best Consumer Health Hack**.

Helix is a doctor-patient relationship management platform that essentially allows the doctor to do several things, including:

* monitoring the patient's vital/relevant health data in a user-friendly dashboard
* view user reports of symptoms, etc
* give the user a prescription over the dashboard, which is then fulfilled and delivered by Postmates' API
