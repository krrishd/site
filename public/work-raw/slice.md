## My Involvement

[Rohan]() and I started Slice Capital in the summer of 2015, right around the time during which equity crowdfunding was becoming legal for non-accredited investors, all while I was spending the summer in Philadelphia as a [PennApps Fellow]. During that time, we worked together primarily on ideation; additionally, I built our initial landing page.

I subsequently became heavily involved in designing our very first iteration of the product, primarily working in Sketch and collaborating with an iOS developer on the implementation. As this was going on, we were finalists for Forbes 30 Under 30 and were recognized as one of [Inc.com's Coolest College Startups]() in 2016. We even won second place on their bracket comprised of those startups.

From there, we expanded our legal and business development teams to accomodate the increasing demand for our product; a lot of the work involved was related to achieving compliance with FINRA regulations and working with startups interested in raising. During this time I was involved in two projects: building out a waitlist system that incentivized sharing our platform in exchange for a higher spot on the waitlist for the beta, and prototyping the dashboard that startups would see when filling out relevant info about their campaigns. I was also in charge of handling more marketing-oriented tasks such as upkeep of the landing page and setup/deployment of open-source software such as Sendy to use internally.

Late in 2016, we received notice from Forbes that we were top 4 finalists in their Under 30 Changemakers competition; Rohan and Nihar (our biz dev lead) pitched to a Forbes-run panel of investors such as Ashton Kutcher, and we were subsequently funded by Rough Draft Ventures.

Early 2017 onwards, I started getting more busy with school and began narrowing the scope of my work with Slice, and we onboarded our new CTO (Dan Stepanov). I'm currently loosely involved with the team, stepping in when my web dev work comes in handy; the team is on track to launch soon, and I'm excited to see where Slice takes the world of investment!
